# Dublin Bikes

Hi There,

This is my first Software project, A Dublin Bikes Application to view different bike stations in Dublin. 
Created with: 
- flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- With Help from Google maps API and Scraped infromation from JCDecaux website for infromation on bike stations locations and stats 

This Section Will include screenshots and description on how to run your own instance of this Web-App soon.
